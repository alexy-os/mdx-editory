# TypeScript Configuration

Relevant source files

- [package.json](https://github.com/ui8kit/core/blob/2afe2195/package.json)

- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/ui8kit/core/blob/2afe2195/tsconfig.json)

This document provides a detailed explanation of the TypeScript configuration in `@ui8kit/core`, covering compilation settings, type generation, path aliases, and module resolution. The configuration is defined in [tsconfig.json1-26](https://github.com/ui8kit/core/blob/2afe2195/tsconfig.json#L1-L26) and integrates with the build system documented in [Build System](#3.6).

For information about the distribution artifacts generated by TypeScript compilation, see [Package Structure](#3.5). For details on how types are used in component APIs, see [API Reference](#4).

## Configuration Overview

The TypeScript configuration serves three primary functions: compiling source code from `src/` to ES2022 modules in `dist/`, generating type declaration files (`.d.ts`) for IDE autocomplete and type checking, and establishing path aliases for clean imports.
